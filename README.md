# Newsletter Signup and Management with PHP #
This is a simple tool, written in PHP, which allows users to sign up for a newsletter. It allows the website owner, to send mails to all users in the database and it allows them, to remove users,
right from the website. 

## Security Information ##
This is just a very basic tool showing capabilities of PHP, HTML and mySQL. It lacks some security features, such as login to access the send and delete mail features. In addation, there is no 
separate database config, meaning, that db information might be public. 

*** DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, WITHOUT MAKING THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES! ***

## Additional Information ## 

This is provided as is. Though future development might take place, this is more of a showcase and training project for me, which I work on, for fun. As such, there is no development cycle and no 
guaranteed updates, etc.
